8-Bit Retro Gaming Experiments

This project is primarily a bunch of experiments with the main purpose of deepening my knowledge about the essential aspects of computing. Everything is being shared openly in the hope other people may also get some learning from it, but everythin is provided "as is" in the rawest conceivable form.

## What **not** to expect from this project
* Any sort of commerically viable product.
* Any compatibility with existing (past or current) machines.
** Some degree of compatibility may happen as a side effect from using some similar components, such as the 65C02 chip family. Keep in mind that this is a side effect and not an intentional feature: no effort or thought will be put in this regard, if it happens it just happens.
* Anything that makes sense to mass produce.
** Of course, if someone still wants to mass produce this system, that's up to them. Just because it makes no sense it doesn't mean you can't do it.

## What to expect from this project
* Things made from scratch whenever viable
* A deep look at how, and why, each element works
* Learning why some things were done the way they were in the 8-bit era, and what has actually changed on modern systems
* Breadboards. Lots of breadboards! Eventually there will be some soldered boards, but everything begins on breadboards, and many elements may stay in those forever.
